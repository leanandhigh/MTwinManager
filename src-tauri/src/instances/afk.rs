//! Anti-AFK. Roblox disconnects a player after 20 minutes without input (reason 278). Every
//! `Settings.anti_afk.interval_min` minutes, each client in a game that hasn't opted out
//! (`Instance.anti_afk`) is brought to the front for a moment, gets a real F13 press through
//! `SendInput` (by scan code, as a keyboard sends it; no game binds F13, so the character
//! doesn't move), and the window that was in front gets the focus back. One client at a time,
//! about 100 ms each. Only while nobody has touched the keyboard or mouse for 5 s
//! (`GetLastInputInfo`); otherwise it tries again 30 s later. A minimized client is restored for
//! its press (`window::unhide`) and minimized again.
//!
//! Measured 2026-11-02 on minimized clients over 21 minutes: keys posted to the window
//! (WM_KEYDOWN, with or without WM_ACTIVATE) and focus without a key don't count as activity
//! and the client is kicked; a real Space or F13 does. Games with their own idle handling
//! teleport such clients back to spawn before the kick, which stops egg hatching.
//!
//! Nothing is injected into or read from the client; auto-rejoin on the 278 kick stays the
//! fallback.
